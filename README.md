# Overview
This is a repository built from my Udacity Front-End web class.

The project showcases my ability to make a website very responsive. **Grunt** was used to resize and compress the images. To run **Grunt**, can use **npm** and must have it installed with **Node JS**. The images are stored in folders based on their dimension.

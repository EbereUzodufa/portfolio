# Overview
This is a repository built from my Udacity Front-End web class.
The project showcases my ability to make website very responsive.
**Grunt** was used to resize and compress the images. To run **Grunt**, can use **npm** and must have it nstalled with **Node JS**. The images are stored in folders based on their dimension.
